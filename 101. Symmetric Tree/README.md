## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:

![alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```
Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
